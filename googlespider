Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how GoogleSpider and its affiliates ("GoogleSpider," "we," "us," or "our") collect, use, and share information when you use our websites, services, and applications (collectively referred to as the "Services"). Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the information processed by our customers when using our Services.

We may collect and receive information about users of our Services ("users," "you," or "your") from various sources, such as:
- Information you provide when you register for an account on the Services (your "Account").
- Information obtained from your use of the Services.

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our data collection, use, and disclosure practices. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at qianshangu@gmail.com.

Additionally, when you use our Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, landing page, and referring URL. A cookie may be placed on your computer or device when you visit our Services. Cookies contain a small amount of information that enables our web servers to recognize you. We store information collected through cookies, log files, and/or clear gifs to record your preferences. We may also automatically collect information about your use of features of our Services, the functionality of our Services, frequency of visits, and other information related to your interactions with the Services. We may track your use across different websites and services. In some countries, including those in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the information mentioned above in this paragraph may be considered personal information under relevant data protection laws.

Information Received from Third Parties:
- **Third-Party Accounts:** If you link our Services to a third-party account, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize the linking. If you want to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.

3. Information Sharing

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
- **With Your Consent:** We may share information with your consent.

4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information
The legal basis for collecting and using personal information depends on the specific personal information and the context in which it was collected.

Typically, we will only collect personal information from you: (1) if we need it to fulfill a contract with you; (2) if processing is in our legitimate interests and does not override your rights; or (3) if we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary for the provision of these Services, such as responding to your queries, improving our platform, conducting marketing, or detecting and preventing illegal activities.

In some cases, we may also be legally obligated to collect personal information from you or may need it to protect your or another person's vital interests.

If we ask you to provide personal information to fulfill a legal requirement or contract with you, we will make this clear and inform you whether providing the information is mandatory and the consequences if it is not provided.

5. Access
If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our Services or emailing qianshangu@gmail.com. If you cancel your account, any public activity that was on your account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may still be accessible to the public.

To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide to us may be archived or stored periodically for backup purposes as part of our normal business operations for disaster recovery. There may be temporary limitations to your ability to access and correct your information if doing so would: impede GoogleSpider's compliance with a legal obligation; impede GoogleSpider's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in the disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in a breach of contract or the disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to GoogleSpider or a third party.

6. Data Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have a continuing legitimate business requirement to do so (for example, to provide you with a requested service or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting regulations).

Once we no longer have a legitimate business requirement to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If that is not feasible (for example, if your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store it and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.

7. Security
GoogleSpider is dedicated to safeguarding your information. To achieve this, we employ a range of security technologies and procedures aimed at preventing unauthorized access, usage, or disclosure of your information. The measures we implement are designed to provide a level of security that is suitable for the level of risk involved in processing your personal information. However, it is important to note that the internet cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. Your Data Protection Rights Under the GDPR
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights:
- You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request the portability of your personal information by emailing qianshangu@gmail.com.
- You can access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information at any time by contacting qianshangu@gmail.com.
- If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the legality of any processing we carried out prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information based on lawful grounds other than consent.
- You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send to
