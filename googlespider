Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how GoogleSpider and its affiliates ("GoogleSpider," "we," "us," or "our") collect, use, and share information when you use our websites, services, and applications (collectively referred to as the "Services"). Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the information processed by our customers when using our Services.

We may collect and receive information about users of our Services ("users," "you," or "your") from various sources, such as:
- Information you provide when you register for an account on the Services (your "Account").
- Information obtained from your use of the Services.
- Information from third-party websites, services, and partners.
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our data collection, use, and disclosure practices. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at qianshangu@gmail.com.

1. Information Collected
 (1) Information Provided by You
- **Account Registration:** When you sign up for an Account, we may request your contact details, including your name, email address, and phone number. If you decide to refer a friend to our Services, we may also collect your friend's email address to send them a referral or promotional code to join our Services.
- **Communications:** If you reach out to us directly, we may receive additional information from you such as your name, email address, phone number, the content and/or attachments in the message you send us, and any other information you choose to provide. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.
- **Payment Information:** If you add your financial account information to your Account, it will be directed to our third-party payment processor. We don't store your financial account information on our systems, but we may have access to and retain subscriber information through our third-party payment processor.

 (2) Information Collected When Using Our Services:
- **Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** Like most websites, we automatically gather certain information and store it in log files. Additionally, when you use our Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, landing page, and referring URL. A cookie may be placed on your computer or device when you visit our Services. Cookies contain a small amount of information that enables our web servers to recognize you. We store information collected through cookies, log files, and/or clear gifs to record your preferences. We may also automatically collect information about your use of features of our Services, the functionality of our Services, frequency of visits, and other information related to your interactions with the Services. We may track your use across different websites and services. In some countries, including those in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the information mentioned above in this paragraph may be considered personal information under relevant data protection laws.

Information Received from Third Parties:
- **Third-Party Accounts:** If you link our Services to a third-party account, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize the linking. If you want to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.

- **Third-Party Partners:** We may also receive publicly available information about you from our third-party partners and combine it with data that we have about you.

3. Information Sharing

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
- **With Your Consent:** We may share information with your consent.

4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information
The legal basis for collecting and using personal information depends on the specific personal information and the context in which it was collected.

Typically, we will only collect personal information from you: (1) if we need it to fulfill a contract with you; (2) if processing is in our legitimate interests and does not override your rights; or (3) if we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary for the provision of these Services, such as responding to your queries, improving our platform, conducting marketing, or detecting and preventing illegal activities.

In some cases, we may also be legally obligated to collect personal information from you or may need it to protect your or another person's vital interests.

If we ask you to provide personal information to fulfill a legal requirement or contract with you, we will make this clear and inform you whether providing the information is mandatory and the consequences if it is not provided.

5. Access
If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our Services or emailing qianshangu@gmail.com. If you cancel your account, any public activity that was on your account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may still be accessible to the public.

To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide to us may be archived or stored periodically for backup purposes as part of our normal business operations for disaster recovery. There may be temporary limitations to your ability to access and correct your information if doing so would: impede GoogleSpider's compliance with a legal obligation; impede GoogleSpider's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in the disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in a breach of contract or the disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to GoogleSpider or a third party.

6. Data Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have a continuing legitimate business requirement to do so (for example, to provide you with a requested service or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting regulations).

Once we no longer have a legitimate business requirement to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If that is not feasible (for example, if your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store it and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.

7. Security
GoogleSpider is dedicated to safeguarding your information. To achieve this, we employ a range of security technologies and procedures aimed at preventing unauthorized access, usage, or disclosure of your information. The measures we implement are designed to provide a level of security that is suitable for the level of risk involved in processing your personal information. However, it is important to note that the internet cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. Your Data Protection Rights Under the GDPR
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights:
1. You can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request the portability of your personal information by emailing qianshangu@gmail.com.
2. You can access, correct, update, or request the deletion of your personal information at any time by contacting qianshangu@gmail.com.
3. If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the legality of any processing we carried out prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information based on lawful grounds other than consent.
4. You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send to you at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing, please contact us at qianshangu@gmail.com.
5. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority regarding our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals seeking to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

9. Your Choices
You have the option to use some of our Services without having to register, which limits the type of information we collect from you.
You can also choose to unsubscribe from receiving promotional emails from us by simply following the instructions provided at the end of the email. Despite this, we may still need to contact you for important account-related, informational, or transactional purposes.

Many web browsers offer the option to disable cookies. Doing so may prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or allow you to choose which cookies to accept. Please note that disabling cookies may affect some features of our Services and the personalization of your experience. Although you will continue to receive advertising material, it will not be tailored to your interests.

10. International Data Transfers
GoogleSpider operates globally, with a base in the United States. As a result, we may need to transfer your personal information to countries outside of the one where the information was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as your home country. Nevertheless, we will always protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We regularly review and update this Privacy Policy. Any changes made will be posted on our websites and, if necessary, communicated to you through our Services, email, or other means.

12. Children's Privacy
GoogleSpider does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and prohibits their use of our Services. If you become aware of any violation of this Privacy Policy by a child, please alert us at qianshangu@gmail.com.
